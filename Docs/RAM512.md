# Module: RAM512

## Description
This module emulates the [512k ROM 512k RAM Module](https://rc2014.co.uk/modules/512k-rom-512k-ram-module/) from RC2014.

## Ports
This module uses ports **0x78** to **0x7B**. 

## Interrupts
None.

## Function
The module is interesting as the Z80 is only capable of addressing 64k at one time.  

### Memory Banks
To allow the complete ROM and RAM to be accessed the memory address space is divided into four banks of 16 KiB.

| Bank # | Start Address | End Address |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
|    0   | 0x0000        |  0x3FFF     |
|    1   | 0x4000        |  0x7FFF     |
|    2   | 0x8000        |  0xBFFF     |
|    3   | 0xC000        |  0xFFFF     |

### Physical memory divisions
The physical memory is divided into 16 KiB pages.
* Pages 0 - 31 are mapped to ROM space.
* Pages 32 - 63 are mapped to RAM space.

In the real implementation these pages are 16KiB pages in the respective ROM or SRAM chip, but in this emulator, to keep things simpler I have simply defined it as 64 16KiB byte arrays.

### Page switching
Each bank is controlled by a port address.  To change the page accessed from the bank the page number is simply written to the corresponding port.

| Name     | Port |   Description                    |
|----------|------|----------------------------------|
| MPGSEL_0 | 0x78 | Page select register for bank #0 |
| MPGSEL_1 | 0x79 | Page select register for bank #1 |
| MPGSEL_2 | 0x7A | Page select register for bank #2 |
| MPGSEL_3 | 0x7B | Page select register for bank #3 |
